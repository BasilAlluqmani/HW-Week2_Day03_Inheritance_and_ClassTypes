# Kotlin Essentials (Inheritance and Class types)
---
The Kotlin assignment has two components:
- Part I: Practice with Inheritance.
- Part II: Practice with Class types. 

## Part I - Practice with Inheritance.

To apply the Inheritance concept, create one superclass called `Shape` that has two properties called `shapeName` and `shapeColor`, and also has two functions one called `info()` that return name and color of shape and the other one called `computeArea()` that has no parameter, and return Double data type.

On the other hand, there are three subclasses that inherit from the superclass called `Triangle`, `Rectangle`, and `Circle`. Each subclass has different properties according to it. For example, Rectangle has `width` and `height` properties, Triangle has `base` and `height` properties, and Circle has `pi` and `radius` properties.

You need to change the body of `computeArea()` in each subclass to make sure this function will compute the area according to the subclass' name. For example, `computeArea()` in the `Triangle` subclass will calculate the triangle area, and so on.

```sh
Formulas to compute area:
`Circle area = pi times the radius squared (A = π*r²)`
`Rectangle area = height times width  (A = h * w)`
`Triangle area = half of height times base (A = (h * b)/2 )`
```

## Part II - Practice with Class types.

### Open Questions:
- What is the difference between `enum classes` and `data classes`?
- >An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface),
- >A data class is something that holds the data for us. It doesn’t hold any other functionality in it.
- 
- Which one of the `object` keyword ways can be used for the inheritance concept?
- >open 
-} open class Car // Class is open for inheritance
